# iPhone widgets: shared data and implementation gates

**Archived research — excluded from the iOS release by user request on
29 October 2026 (Europe/Paris).** The following implementation/evidence history
is retained for reference. WidgetKit rendering, provisioning and actions are
not release gates. The app does not start the iOS publisher/sampler or register
its widget publication channel; the research workflow is manual-only. Android
widgets and iPhone system media controls remain separate and unchanged.

Status: native publication/sampler contracts and standalone extension linkage accepted; rendering candidate, 27 October 2026 (Europe/Paris).
The canonical-state builder and Swift/Foundation reader pass the hosted Swift 6
[shared contract run](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40447057390):
45 shared cases plus native numeric/clock guards and 64 Dart contracts. The [storage run](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40450346881)
also passes 19 real filesystem/image/process cases and the actual iOS 16 arm64
device plus arm64 simulator SDK checks with Swift 6 warnings treated as errors.
The [corrected publication run](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40472952795)
passes the reader's 45 cases, storage's 20 cases and publication's 14 cases,
plus the actual iOS 16 SDK checks. The current candidate adds the host channel
and Flutter coordinator. The later run-14 correction passes 23 storage cases,
50×24-worker POSIX and real-store rounds, 45 reader, 14 publisher and 88 Flutter
cases plus both real bridge SDK checks. The [live-sampler contract run 15](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40510204249)
passes 48 reader cases, the same 23 store cases and both stress controls, 14
publisher cases, 109 Flutter contracts and both real Flutter bridge SDK checks.
**Full runtime sampling acceptance remains pending. The standalone WidgetKit
candidate is not embedded or provisioned in the main IPA.**

The product remains exactly three configurations—Now Playing, Flow / Radio and
Cover Flow—with responsive small/medium/large families. Artwork, Dynamic Type,
Reduce Motion, empty/offline states and iOS 16/17 action differences follow the
[post-172 widget specification](IOS_POST172_REVIEW.md#widgetkit-design-and-implementation-gates).
The existing Android publisher and its settings remain independent.

The reader is deliberately independent of UIKit/WidgetKit and can be compiled
and exercised before extension provisioning. The new macOS contract workflow
compiles the real reader in Swift 6 with warnings as errors; Dart and Swift run
the same expected fixture values. A host/reader pass establishes the wire
boundary, not extension installation, rendering or signed-device behavior.

## Version 1 wire boundary

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Exactly 1; unknown/missing/bool versions produce an empty snapshot. Unknown additive fields are discarded. |
| `revision` | Nonnegative integer through 2^53−1. Future persistence must allocate it monotonically and acknowledge the actual written revision. |
| `updatedAtMs` | Milliseconds since UTC epoch, positive through 2100-01-01. Invalid/missing time is stale. |
| `current` | Nullable metadata record: alias, title, artist, album and owned artwork filename. No codec/backend or delivery URL is inferred. |
| Record `id` | 64 lowercase hex characters. The app builder hashes `lokal-widget-track-v1` + NUL + the stable app song ID with SHA-256. It never exports raw IDs/paths/remote IDs. |
| Labels/status | At most 256 Unicode scalars / 1024 UTF-8 bytes; controls and invalid surrogates are discarded. Bound scanning to 1024 input scalars. Trim ASCII spaces consistently across runtimes. |
| `artwork`, `lastArtwork` | Content-addressed 64-hex `.jpg`/`.png` filename only. No URL, absolute path, traversal or URI. Current valid art replaces last-good art; unavailable art retains an explicitly supplied valid last-good filename. |
| `positionMs`, `durationMs` | Integral, nonnegative and at most seven days. A known duration caps position; no current record clears both values. This display limit does not restrict playback. |
| `isPlaying`, `playbackRate` | Explicit bool and finite rate 0.25–4.0. A missing record cannot be playing; no string/numeric truth conversion. |
| `accentArgb` | Valid signed Int32; legacy unsigned UInt32 becomes its signed bit pattern. Reject out-of-range/fractional/bool values before conversion. Zero delegates to the renderer's theme default. |
| `queueCount` | Integer 0–1,000,000, from canonical `upNext` count. |
| `flowKind`, `flowStatus` | `none` / `flow` / `radio`, plus bounded app-localized status. No discovery starts while building the snapshot. |
| `recommendations` | At most 12 distinct valid records from the first 48 candidates. Invalid rows fall back independently. |

Documents are bounded to 64 KiB and eight nesting levels before parsing. Both
decoders reject malformed Unicode/nonfinite JSON consistently. They normalize
individual damaged fields without discarding unrelated valid metadata. Every
accepted normalized document must round-trip within the same byte budget.

Progress projects only a confirmed playing, known-duration, current recording.
Use the captured raw position, elapsed wall time and captured playback rate,
capped at duration. Hold the recorded position when paused, over 15 minutes old,
more than five minutes in the future, or missing a valid timestamp. Validate
extreme clock values before subtraction/conversion. This contract never causes
playback or uses a periodic widget process to imitate a live player.

## Next implementation boundaries

1. **Atomic store and artwork.** Resolve the actual provisioned App Group at
   runtime; report unavailable explicitly. Copy/downsample verified artwork into
   the owned group directory with byte/pixel limits, content hashes and atomic
   writes. Reject symlink escapes. Write the complete snapshot atomically after
   its referenced assets exist; serialize publications and reject a superseded
   acknowledgement. Retain referenced/last-good artwork during cleanup. Do not
   fetch remote artwork inside an extension render pass.
2. **Read-only WidgetKit target.** Implement the three layouts from the shared
   spec, theme-derived surfaces, accessibility labels, stale/empty states and
   system progress. Validate the exact extension's device/simulator linkage,
   rendered family/large-text snapshots and timeline reload budgeting. The basic
   sideload IPA must remain independent of extension entitlements.
3. **Owned commands.** Use iOS 16 deep links and eligible iOS 17+ AppIntent entry
   points. A durable bounded inbox needs command UUID, expiry, expected current
   alias/revision and an absolute action, so replay cannot toggle twice or play
   the wrong newer selection. The app must validate, serialize, perform and
   acknowledge through the existing playback coordinator. The extension must
   never create another Flutter/Rust engine. App-start failures remain visible;
   dequeuing a command is not playback acknowledgement.
4. **Windows/device acceptance.** Prove matching host/extension App Groups in
   the actual free-account profile and Windows re-sign/install/upgrade/refresh
   path. Apple's capability table is not proof of a particular profile or tool.
   A missing group must leave base-app playback usable and explain widget
   availability. No paid-membership assumption or signing credential belongs in
   this repository or CI.

Current Dart coverage includes the shared corruption/legacy/progress corpus,
immutable exports, maximum-size payload, canonical clock/theme mapping, stable
aliases, bounded recommendations and absence of source URLs/private paths.
The Foundation executable additionally checks extreme native clock/numeric
values. Actual WidgetKit rendering, background controls and signed installation
remain open until those later gates pass.


## Atomic store and artwork candidate

`LokalWidgetStore` accepts an explicitly supplied container; its optional iOS
factory resolves the actual provisioned App Group or throws unavailable. A
read-only instance cannot create a missing store. The host publisher is not
wired, so this introduces no entitlement dependency into base-app startup.

The store opens its owned directory without following a terminal symlink and
retains that descriptor. All subsequent I/O uses fixed/validated flat names and
`openat` / `renameat` / `unlinkat`. Regular-file and single-link checks reject
FIFOs, directories and hard links; nonblocking opens prevent a planted FIFO from
hanging the widget. Moving/replacing the original container path cannot redirect
a held descriptor to another directory. Instance locking and a regular-file
`flock` serialize separate threads, instances and processes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Future host publisher
  participant I as ImageIO preparation
  participant S as Owned store + process lock
  participant R as Widget reader
  P->>I: Bounded PNG/JPEG bytes, off the main queue
  I-->>P: Downsampled metadata-free PNG + content hash
  P->>S: Candidate revision + referenced prepared images
  S->>S: Reject stale revision; validate cache and asset set
  S->>S: Write and fsync owned temporary images; rename
  S->>S: Verify every referenced image hash
  S->>S: Preserve previous snapshot; atomically rename new snapshot
  S-->>P: Acknowledge the committed revision
  R->>S: Bounded regular-file snapshot / image reads
  S-->>R: Complete old or new document, verified image bytes
```

| Boundary | Candidate behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Artwork input | PNG/JPEG only, complete single image, at most 12 MiB, each dimension at most 12,000 and at most 40 million pixels before decoding. |
| Artwork output | ImageIO applies orientation and downsamples to a maximum 600px edge; new PNG encoding removes original metadata. At most 2 MiB per owned image; filename is SHA-256 of the encoded bytes. |
| Cache | At most 32 artwork files / 16 MiB. Preserve current/previous references and ten minutes of reader grace. Remove only expired unreferenced owned artwork. Reclaim a dead writer's temporaries while holding the exclusive writer lock. |
| Publication | Positive revision greater than the committed revision; all referenced images must exist and verify before acknowledgement. No unreferenced or duplicate prepared image batch. |
| Write failure | Complete current snapshot remains available. Partial asset staging is reusable verified cache, never a claimed new snapshot. |
| Cache full | Return an explicit error. A metadata-only update retaining an existing verified cover remains possible; the future publisher must use that fallback rather than freeze title/state. |
| Bad stored snapshot | Reject oversized/malformed/future-schema data explicitly; do not silently overwrite it. An explicit owned-cache repair action belongs in host integration. |
| File protection | Device temporaries require protection class C (after first unlock). Simulator skips this kernel policy; signed-device/lock-screen verification remains open. |

The new macOS executable exercises nineteen actual filesystem/image/process
cases, including independent native child processes, descriptor/path replacement,
symlinks, hard links, FIFOs, real permission denial, image decoding/metadata
removal, incomplete assets, cache quotas and reference/grace retention. The
workflow also type-checks the source with the actual iOS 16 device and simulator
SDK targets. These gates pass in run `40450346881`, job `122011345223`, at
source `e7ed8035126e1d645f17c1f23a6761ee05c5fb71`, tree
`1be6c4c35decac65e9e16cf36fcddb98d09f43c5`. This is native storage evidence,
not App Group entitlement or extension installation evidence.

Atomic rename establishes reader visibility and failure behavior; physical
power-loss durability, actual App Group sandbox access, protected-device reads,
background execution and WidgetKit timelines still require their own acceptance.
The existing Android publisher and playback/transport code are unchanged.


The first storage workflow passes the unchanged 45-case Swift reader and Dart
checks, then stops at the iOS device SDK check: the SDK does not expose the
`PROTECTION_CLASS_C` alias. The correction uses Foundation's public
`completeFileProtectionUntilFirstUserAuthentication` policy on a private probe,
verifies the reported Foundation attribute, reads that descriptor's actual class
and applies it to the held owned-file descriptor. No private keybag constant is
guessed. Probe failure stays explicit and is retried on a later publication;
simulator code does not claim device protection. The corrected device/simulator SDK checks and all nineteen storage cases
pass in the hosted run above. Physical file-protection behavior remains pending.


## Host publication policy candidate

`Publication/LokalWidgetPublisher.swift` adds the synchronous native publication
policy, intended for a host-owned utility queue. It does not construct an audio
engine, resolve an implicit App Group, fetch artwork, reload timelines or attach
the Flutter host yet. The bridge must first confirm the installed shared-container
capability; base-app playback remains independent of that capability.

The input is the bounded canonical metadata document plus image bytes keyed by
its opaque current/recommendation aliases. At most thirteen images and 12 MiB
in aggregate are accepted before image decoding. Unknown aliases and stale
revisions fail explicitly. Snapshot normalization removes unrelated input fields;
prepared artwork is content-addressed and deduplicated before committing.

The returned acknowledgement contains the actual committed revision, owned
filenames by alias, last-good background artwork and a degraded-artwork flag.
An invalid image preserves a verified same-track cover when available. Artwork
from a different track may remain the separate last-good background; it is never
silently attached as the new track's cover. If the owned cache is full, retry
with verified existing covers and no new images so title/pause/seek metadata can
still advance. Other storage errors and stale writes never become success.
Read the actual stored revision on startup; do not assume a restarted process
can overwrite the previous writer with revision one.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant D as Future Flutter coordinator
  participant H as Native publication policy / utility queue
  participant I as Bounded ImageIO preparation
  participant S as Atomic shared store
  D->>H: Canonical metadata + bounded image bytes by opaque alias
  H->>S: Read actual previous revision and verified artwork
  H->>H: Reject stale/unreferenced/oversized input
  H->>I: Prepare complete owned PNGs
  I-->>H: Hash-named images or explicit image failure
  H->>S: Commit metadata and referenced assets
  alt Cache quota reached
    H->>S: Commit metadata with verified old assets only
  end
  S-->>H: Actual committed revision
  H-->>D: Revision + owned artwork names + degraded-art flag
  Note over D: Only acknowledge the matching latest request
```

Fourteen new native cases exercise actual storage/images, restarted revision
reads, duplicate covers, invalid images, distinct-track fallback, stale writers,
unreferenced images, aggregate quotas, bad schema/documents, allowlist privacy,
full-cache metadata fallback and concurrent publication. The hosted workflow
compiles the same policy with Swift 6 warnings-as-errors and both iOS 16 SDK
targets before running those cases. These policy checks subsequently passed in
run 40472952795; the initial pending status is superseded by that native result. The preceding reader/store
passes remain scoped to their original source; no app bridge, WidgetKit layout,
App Group provisioning, timeline or physical-device acceptance is inferred.


### Held-reader inode replacement correction

The first publication workflow passes the unchanged 64 Flutter contracts, all
45 Swift reader cases, and both actual iOS 16 SDK checks **including the new
publisher**. Its storage concurrency case then fails; publication execution is
skipped in that run. The reader previously required `st_nlink == 1` after
`openat`. A writer can legitimately replace that exact pathname between open
and fstat, reducing the held old descriptor's link count to zero even though
its complete immutable bytes remain readable.

Bounded reads now accept a regular held descriptor with zero or one link.
`O_NOFOLLOW`, nonregular/FIFO rejection, hard-link rejection (`> 1`), and strict
single-link writer/cleanup descriptors remain. A deterministic new storage case
performs an actual independent-store commit immediately after the reader's open
and before its fstat: the held read must return complete revision one, and the
next read complete revision two. The test hook is absent by default. Native
storage now has twenty cases and logs the actual concurrency errors if any
recur. The publication suite runs independently after prior failures while the
workflow retains every failing gate. Run 40472952795 subsequently passed all
20 storage cases, 14 publication cases, 45 reader cases, 64 Flutter cases and
both iOS 16 SDK checks for source `1cfc1ae59f47b95368afcda863c04fda5bc34b5b`.


## Host channel and request coordinator candidate

`LokalWidgetBridge` registers `lokal/widgets` in the actual Runner; its shared
contract/store/publication sources are explicit Xcode target members. A serial
utility queue owns image preparation and storage. Results and any requested
WidgetKit reload return on the main queue, only after a real commit. A timeline
reload request is not proof of rendering or guaranteed scheduling.

The bridge resolves only the installed bundle's optional `LokalWidgetAppGroup`
configuration. **Setting an identifier does not grant an entitlement.** The
standalone IPA leaves that key absent. It returns `notConfigured` without opening
any container; an inaccessible configured group is explicitly unavailable.
Corrupt storage reports repair required. No private app-container fallback,
caller-provided group identifier, source path or second audio owner is created.
A native integration probe exercises this exact unconfigured bridge and its
rejected publication, before continuing ordinary app/playback acceptance; that
new native app probe still requires its first hosted execution. The focused
macOS workflow also checks the real bridge against the downloaded Flutter
framework for both iOS 16 SDK targets with Swift 6 warnings-as-errors. Its
one-shot reply wrapper transfers typed sendable payloads across queues and
invokes Flutter callbacks on the main queue; no mock Flutter API stands in for
the actual framework during this check.

`IosWidgetPublicationCoordinator` accepts already sampled canonical snapshots.
It coalesces pending requests, serializes acknowledged writes, reads the stored
revision on preflight, preserves the supplied source timestamp/position, and
discards obsolete artwork results and receipts. Counters cannot wrap or reuse a
failed operation's revision. A timed-out image future remains owned until its
real completion, so another stuck image job cannot pile up. Fresh metadata can
still be published without new images. Explicit retry rechecks availability;
retained failed work does not create a retry/polling loop. A request submitted
while a failure notification is being delivered is scheduled exactly once.

The method-channel transport validates native wire types/revisions, allows
image keys only for referenced opaque aliases, and bounds image count/aggregate
bytes. The coordinator validates receipt identity and owned filenames before
exposing them. Fourteen asynchronous coordinator cases plus seven actual-codec
method-channel cases pass; the complete widget selection now passes **85 Flutter
contracts** with strict analysis reporting no issues. The expanded app selection
plus these cases passes **525 Flutter tests**. Host analysis has no errors.

The runtime sampler still needs to bind canonical player/theme/Flow state,
read materialized owned artwork, and budget state/seek/heartbeat updates. Do not
submit every position tick or replace sampling timestamps with image completion
time. Actual shared-profile publication, extension rendering/actions and the
Windows install/upgrade/refresh path remain independent qualification gates.

The first real-Flutter bridge SDK check caught Swift 6 rejecting Flutter's
imported mutable Objective-C `FlutterMethodNotImplemented` global. The private
channel now returns an explicit `UNSUPPORTED_WIDGET_METHOD` error through its
existing typed, main-queue reply path. No concurrency checks were disabled.
The revised bridge passes the actual Flutter framework check for both iOS 16
SDK targets in [run 40481024530](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40481024530),
source `7fd28cf71417e7ea787b8df7e6cfcce4f26486c1`, tree
`9bc8e5ba0eeff8610f7b7b1d47e527966002e5fc`. All 85 Flutter, 45 reader,
20 storage and 14 publisher cases also pass. Full app channel execution,
provisioned publication and extension rendering remain separate gates.


## Native operation ownership after a deadline

A Dart deadline bounds the caller's wait; it cannot cancel a native file write
or a queued capability check. The coordinator retains those real futures until
completion. Fresh states coalesce into one pending request while a timed-out
write remains owned: no second native operation or artwork job is started.
Capability retries share the existing in-flight check. Late replies/errors
release ownership without exposing an obsolete receipt, notifying disposed
listeners, or creating an automatic retry loop. A later explicit retry or
meaningful state update can publish the latest retained sample with a new
revision, after checking actual availability again when requested.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Canonical player state
  participant D as Dart coordinator
  participant N as Native utility queue
  D->>N: Publish revision 1
  Note over D: Wait deadline expires; retain native operation
  P->>D: Newer sampled state
  Note over D: Coalesce latest; start no second native or artwork job
  N-->>D: Late success or error
  Note over D: Release ownership; discard late receipt; do not auto-retry
  P->>D: Next meaningful update or explicit retry
  D->>N: Publish latest sample at a new revision
```

Three asynchronous regressions cover hung publication with repeated new states
and retries, a hung capability check, and late native failure. Actual in-flight
publication concurrency stays at one; late completions never publish stale
acknowledgements. The full widget/Android-widget selection passes **88 Flutter
tests**. These checks extend the 583-test parity checkpoint; they do not claim a
new combined full-app native pass or make the runtime sampler available.


## Intermittent store failure — investigation open

[Native run 8](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40483084962)
passes the actual Flutter bridge SDK checks, 85 Flutter cases, 45 reader cases
and 14 publisher cases, then fails the store's independent-instance concurrent
publication case with `posix(2)` (ENOENT). Earlier runs 5 and 7 pass the complete
store suite, so they do not establish absence of this intermittent failure.

The diagnostic continuation labels the exact failing POSIX operation and captures
errno before constructing diagnostic values. The focused native workflow now runs
50 independent 24-worker publication/read rounds, keeping highest-revision and
untorn-read assertions. It preserves all failure gates and the existing strict
file protections. No guessed locking change, ignored ENOENT, weakened assertions
or fixed-race claim accompanies this investigation. Swift execution and both SDK
checks for the diagnostic source remain pending; widget runtime wiring remains
blocked on resolving the failure.

Native run 9 also fails storage, this time at the separate-process case; its
child wrapper previously discarded the underlying error. Diagnostics now retain
the child's error, exit status and termination reason, and identify the fixed or
opaque owned filename for failed regular-file opens. No private source path or
credential is logged. The investigation remains open.

The widget workflow now runs native Foundation/storage/image checks in an
independent macOS job, alongside Dart and real-Flutter bridge checks. The failing
filesystem probe no longer waits for Flutter setup/downloads. Both job outcomes
remain required for overall workflow success; no storage or SDK gate is removed.

Native run 12 localizes the thread-contention failure to `open_regular:writer.lock`
with ENOENT at stress round six. The next source captures openat's result/errno
inside the C-string lifetime and includes requested flags plus held-directory
status/link count. A separate POSIX-only control uses stable directory descriptors
and compares ordinary concurrent O_CREAT with O_EXCL/EEXIST fallback, without the
publisher, pruning, snapshots or locks. This isolates syscall/creation behavior
before choosing a production correction; no resolution is claimed yet.


### Lock-file first-create correction candidate

[Native run 13](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40503741762)
reproduces ENOENT in the independent POSIX-only plain O_CREAT control, at round
nine, with the expected flags and a valid held directory (`fstat == 0`, three
links). The failure does not require publication, pruning, snapshots or flock.
The production lock now attempts O_CREAT|O_EXCL and opens the unchanged existing
file only for EEXIST. Other failures propagate; strict regular/single-link and
no-follow validation remains. No lock inode is replaced to obtain a fresh lock.

The corrected POSIX control runs 50 fresh 24-worker rounds, alongside 50 actual
store rounds. New native cases verify lock inode reuse and refusal of existing
symlink/hard-link/FIFO/directory locks. The old plain-create control's failing
source/run remains linked as reproduction evidence; the regression gate now
exercises the chosen exclusive-create protocol. All 23 storage cases, native
SDK checks and actual execution of this correction remain pending.


## Live sampler and owned artwork candidate

The existing canonical player listener now supplies an iOS-only runtime owner.
It publishes track/state/duration/rate/queue-count/theme changes and detected
seeks, with a 60-second metadata-only heartbeat driven by existing events.
There is no new position ticker or per-tick disk write. Theme and completed-art
updates retain the actual source sample timestamp and position; artwork completion
never reanchors the clock. A backwards wall-clock change safely republishes the
new observed sample. Only explicitly supplied recommendations are accepted; live
Flow/Radio/recommendation ownership remains a later binding.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Existing canonical player events] --> S[Meaningful state / seek / heartbeat sampler]
  T[Actual theme accent] --> S
  A[Completed owned cache event] --> S
  S --> C[Single-operation publication coordinator]
  C --> G{Installed shared capability}
  G -->|Unavailable| U[Typed reason; zero artwork reads]
  G -->|Available| O[Bounded owned or existing-cache file reads]
  O --> N[Native ImageIO + atomic store]
  N --> R[Actual committed revision]
```

The artwork loader resolves app support/documents/temporary roots, rejects paths
and symlinks escaping them, limits each source/aggregate byte read, and considers
only current plus twelve referenced aliases. A missing/evicted pointer may use an
already materialized owned replacement. HTTP image references use cache lookup
only; no fetch or decoder/extractor is started. Native ImageIO remains responsible
for validating/downsampling accepted PNG/JPEG bytes before group persistence.
The lifecycle flush never invents a pause. Disposing the app runtime removes the
owned-art listener and stops pending requests; later native results remain owned
until completion under the coordinator's previously tested policy.

Both playback adapters expose loading/buffering separately from requested play.
The shared optional `isBuffering` field defaults false for legacy records and is
strictly boolean. Dart and Swift freeze projected position during buffering while
retaining `isPlaying` for controls. The shared corpus grows to 48 cases; all new
Swift execution and SDK gates still need acceptance for this new source. No Rust
API or audio transport behavior is changed by the presentation flag.

Build 53 separately proves the actual unconfigured native channel in both full
simulator suites. The first-create correction subsequently passes focused native
run 14. Provisioned group access, extension rendering/actions and physical iPhone
or Windows installation remain independent gates.


Validation of the live-sampling candidate: the exact expanded iPhone workflow
selection plus all widget/Android-widget contracts passes **609 Flutter tests**.
This includes actual filesystem ownership/quota/eviction checks, source-clock
sampling and materialized-art events, unavailable-profile/no-I/O and retry/dispose
cases, the expanded 48-case shared wire corpus, and both backend buffering events.
Strict analysis of the new sampler/runtime/artwork code, shared Dart models,
widget tests and recovery probe reports no issues. Whole app/integration analysis
has no errors. Actionlint and diff checks pass. Actual Swift execution/SDK parity
for the new buffering field, live-runtime app acceptance and the observed build-56
retirement timeout remain separate hosted gates.


## Standalone read-only WidgetKit candidate

`ios/Widgets/LokalWidgets.xcodeproj`, shared scheme `LokalWidgets`, builds an
independent extension containing exactly Now Playing, Flow / Radio and Cover
Flow, each supporting small/medium/large. It is deliberately not a dependency or
embedded product of Runner. Neither product acquires an entitlement or an App
Group identifier from this change. The extension's absent `LokalWidgetAppGroup`
key produces an explicit unavailable display; it never substitutes an app-private
container, creates a store, writes a snapshot, fetches art or starts playback.
A future optional package must configure the same real group in both products
and prove the signed Windows workflow before embedding the extension.

The native view uses the captured accent, system contrast surfaces and Dynamic
Type. `ViewThatFits` prioritizes track/open content at accessibility sizes;
VoiceOver retains complete recording metadata. Static artwork and layouts add no
animation. Cover Flow displays up to three actual recommendation records; missing
recommendations and inactive Flow retain an honest open-app state. Current art
can fall back to the explicitly retained owned last-good filename. Reads use the
existing descriptor-relative store and an eight-MiB aggregate display budget.
Before UIKit decodes an image, ImageIO rechecks complete single PNG/JPEG content,
compressed size and the host's 600px per-axis downsample bound. Damaged/evicted art
falls back independently from valid metadata. Labels have all 11 app languages;
widget language follows the extension's iOS localization selection for now.
The app's explicit language preference still needs a shared-language binding.

All entry values crossing WidgetKit completion are typed `Sendable` values.
Timeline planning creates at most four entries: now, a valid future source start,
recording end and strict freshness expiry when relevant. Progress uses the system
`ProgressView(timerInterval:)`; scaling both endpoints respects playback rate.
Paused, buffering, completed, invalid-clock and stale samples do not animate.
There is no wall-clock elapsed label that could misstate audio time at another
rate. At freshness expiry a static stale entry requests a reread; that request is
at most once per 15-minute source window while playing, and never a recurring
extension timer. WidgetKit may defer requests according to its budget. The stale
fallback remains necessary; a system schedule is not a promise of continuous
rendering. Paused/empty/unavailable snapshots rely on subsequent committed host
reloads rather than repeated polling.

The entire widget opens `konnekted://widget`, using the installed app scheme.
This is an open-app entry only: there is no unvalidated play/toggle/seek URL, no
track ID in a deep link and no claim of background control. AppIntent/inbox
commands and Flow/recommendation owner binding remain separate implementation
gates. A read-only extension is not full widget feature parity.

The focused workflow now compiles the presentation/timeline executable against
the shared 48-case corpus and additional native clock/rate/state/image cases,
and separately links the actual extension for device and simulator at iOS 16
with Swift 6 strict concurrency and warnings-as-errors. Local project-reference,
scheme, resource completeness, actionlint and diff checks pass. Hosted compilation,
rendered family/large-text snapshots, actual WidgetKit scheduling, signed group
access and installed-device behavior remain pending for this new source.


### Native linkage accepted; render harness continuation

[Focused run 16](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40516346438)
accepts the first standalone source, tree `0eef6ff8246789cc3585e7e2b7ffd4bc5e81a906`,
at PR head `a28426426ea3d2a1402bb992ef72abe19145f74b`: 18 additional native
presentation/timeline/image cases plus the shared corpus pass, and the actual
extension links for both iOS 16 device and simulator targets. Reader, real store
with both 50×24-worker controls and publisher contracts also pass. The Flutter
metadata/bridge job is tracked separately until it completes.

The next continuation adds the independent `LokalWidgetPreview` app target and
`tool/ios_widget_render.py`. It builds and launches a real native SwiftUI app,
then renders the exact shared layout and surface at explicit family bounds.
The harness supplies normal-app margins; it does not pretend to install a widget
on SpringBoard or exercise WidgetKit container/background scheduling. Runner and
the extension have no dependency on this simulator-only app.

The requested matrix is **441 PNGs**: all three configurations/families, all 11
locales, normal/accessibility-5 text, light/dark appearance, plus English paused,
buffering, stale, empty and unavailable cases. Each locale launches a fresh
process with its actual preferred bundle language and asserts that selection.
Images and per-case JSON are exported from the owned app container; CI verifies
case completeness and exact PNG pixel bounds. Captures remain available for
visual inspection, rather than calling a linker pass a rendering pass. The
smallest accessibility fallback keeps one visual title line and Open Lokal,
while its combined VoiceOver label retains the complete recording metadata.
No animation frames or automatic Home Screen placement are inferred from static
rendered PNGs. This rendering continuation still needs its own hosted pass.


Render run 17 (`40517573731`) passes all native/Flutter/bridge contracts and links
both the extension and the isolated SwiftUI app. Its capture step stops before
installation: CoreSimulator's first device inventory times out after 90 seconds.
No rendered PNG or installed-widget pass is claimed. The startup correction
allows one Simulator-service warm-up and a second bounded inventory only for
that exact pre-device timeout. Both attempts retain separate evidence. Runtime
selection/boot, app installation, rendering, matrix validation and second-attempt
failures propagate normally; no app test is retried. Seven local gate-policy
cases pass, including a real main-flow render-process error without another
boot/launch. Hosted captures remain pending after this infrastructure correction.


Run 18 (`40519562953`, source tree `48bfa0de0503e9c3c19013aa0480d9b8db3c75b0`)
passes the seven startup-policy cases and all existing native/metadata/bridge/
extension gates. The render app links; this time inventory and the full boot
complete, but first installation times out at 90 seconds. No native image pass is
inferred. The continuation uses the same 120-second installation allowance as
the already validated main-app harness and records the exact failing phase,
partial command output, installer/SpringBoard logs, device inventory and a
failure screenshot. Installation/render failures still propagate without retry.
This is a diagnostic/readiness correction, not proof of a packaging fix.


Run 19 (`40521765024`, tree `e6e8a0e9e5c26888305f103fd67110baf092bba3`)
passes the native/metadata/linkage gates and successfully installs the render
app. Launch then times out before producing a report. The preserved SpringBoard
log explicitly says the preview app does not support any valid orientations and
cannot generate a launch snapshot; the failure screenshot remains on SpringBoard.
The isolated target's generated manifest omitted orientations. The correction
uses an explicit simulator-app manifest with portrait orientation, launch screen
and SwiftUI scene metadata, and rejects missing/invalid built orientations before
booting or installing. Eight local policy cases and actual project/plist parsing
pass. Hosted launch/render acceptance is still required. This correction affects
the CI-only app, not Runner or the separately linked extension.


## Native render 20 accepted; visible-content correction

[Run 20](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40524454347)
passes all four focused jobs at source `4e011ab2d8f9d712493c9374ab3b5dc9b80437b2`,
tree `2acce62640442a531872d79dc683015e011ceffc`. The explicit manifest fixes the
isolated app launch. **441 native PNGs** pass actual preferred-language, matrix
and pixel-bound checks across all eleven locales/families/configurations, both
appearances and normal/accessibility text, plus the five English state variants.
All existing native/store/stress/publisher/Dart/real-SDK gates also pass. Artifact
`12743706474` has verified archive SHA-256
`5c9de16e4538e49e12dd67e9b929fd0bb09153da1ee3a555c042aa32f44a61cb`;
the captures and source/checksum record are preserved with a filterable local
review gallery. This remains shared-layout evidence from an actual iPhone
simulator app, not signed Home Screen/App Group qualification.

Visual review exposes a real issue that correct PNG dimensions cannot catch:
medium Now Playing falls back too early, hiding art, artist and progress; medium
Cover Flow similarly loses the three-cover strip. A gradient endpoint with alpha
also leaves the light background dependent on the underlying compositor.

The correction budgets normal-family spacing, metadata fonts and a four-point
linear progress bar explicitly; medium recommendation art uses a bounded 56-point
size. Large Cover Flow additionally shows two title lines and artist metadata.
Flow status shares the footer instead of displacing the recording. The background
has an opaque system surface beneath its accent wash. Combined VoiceOver retains
complete metadata, Flow context and captured progress; accessibility-size layouts
retain their existing prioritized fallback.

The render matrix grows to **450** with nine independent pixel-content checks.
Apple Vision OCR reads the actual English short-fixture PNGs: normal Now Playing
and Flow require both recording and artist; medium/large Cover Flow require all
three recommendation titles. The exported OCR observations are independently
validated by Python. This deliberately fails the earlier title-only fallback;
accessibility labels cannot substitute for text missing from rendered pixels.
Partial images survive a failed capture for review. Eleven local Python startup/
packaging/content-policy cases pass, with diff/actionlint checks. Swift linkage,
the expanded native image/content gates and visual review of the corrected
source remain pending until their own hosted run passes.


## Native render 21: corrected visible content accepted

[Run 21](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40553935455)
passes all four focused jobs at source
`81385f95d49a4596f39f05bf5a9cb41b82724d9f`, tree
`a5b0319364e5ee88236ce250e87dff103c8525aa`. The actual extension links for
device/simulator; existing native/store/concurrency/publisher/Flutter/real-SDK
contracts pass. All **450 native images**, actual bundle-language checks and
**nine pixel OCR checks** pass. Exported OCR identifies recording and artist
for each normal Now Playing/Flow family and all three Cover Flow recommendation
titles in medium/large layouts. The complete matrix and OCR observations are
independently reverified after archive extraction.

Artifact `12756433357` verifies archive SHA-256
`78c5117a9ba06ab026fb61a7c35df78b806bca5aa5d4603c5bf22a3cc860d0f0`.
The actual images, a filterable review gallery and source/checksum record are
preserved locally. Visual inspection confirms the medium content and opaque
light-surface fixes. The live timer bar displays an ImageRenderer unsupported-view
placeholder; the static capture path does not establish correct timer drawing
or animation. Validate that separately in a hosted view and installed widget.
Signed App Group access, Home Screen installation/scheduling, application-language
binding and commands remain separate unfinished gates.

## Displayed native progress follow-up

The preview app now has an isolated foreground mode that hosts the same shared
medium Now Playing layout in a real SwiftUI scene. After the 450-image matrix
passes, the simulator captures two compositor screenshots three seconds apart
in each appearance. A unique launch token, fixed preview bundle and native
active-scene report gate each capture. The test preserves its primary failure
if cleanup also fails, and does not retry an application failure.

The four images and readiness records are exported under
`native-screen-progress/`. Fifteen local Python policy/orchestration tests pass;
their PNG headers are fixtures, not native rendering evidence. Hosted Swift 6
compilation, compositor captures and visual timer review remain pending.
`CAPTURED.json` explicitly leaves automatic progress-animation acceptance false.
This exercises the displayed app-hosted layout; installed WidgetKit, Home Screen
scheduling, App Group provisioning and actual playback remain separate gates.

## Native render 22: displayed progress accepted in the preview app

[Run 22](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40573226374)
passes all four jobs at PR head `851b9080c0c8fb3d22620246157fe24c69069ce1`,
tree `29d3e01f50bf57ce09d31640e633e3c22e573b7a`. The standalone extension links
for device/simulator and all real-SDK/data/storage/publication gates pass.
Archive `12767106863` independently verifies SHA-256
`e3bffe6024a9a3d781589ee5d4f8b94ca53933ab36b38b397c22821280c4a125`;
the 450 static images and nine pixel OCR checks reverify after extraction.

All four compositor images have the exact token/bundle/active-scene readiness
record. Visual inspection confirms metadata/artwork and a rendered progress bar
that advances between frames in both appearances. The native screen captures,
readiness records and source/checksum review gallery are preserved separately
from the static matrix. Automatic animation acceptance remains false in the
capture report: this is an explicit visual review, not a quantitative animation
test. Installed WidgetKit, application-language binding, signed shared access,
command actions and Home Screen scheduling remain unfinished gates.


### Parent stabilization validation — 28 October 2026

[Widget run 23](https://github.com/lokal-music/lokal-mobile/actions/runs/40672723473)
passes all four focused jobs again at the parent stabilization checkpoint:
metadata/real host bridge, native storage/publication policies, extension
linkage and render/capture orchestration. Run 22 retains its independently
reviewed compositor captures. These successes do not embed or provision the
extension in the engineering IPA and do not qualify installed WidgetKit behavior.
